## Overview
The project integrates three main components:
1. **AR Collaboration**: Enables virtual meetings and collaboration spaces using augmented reality (AR) tools where employees can interact with 3D models and documents as if they were physically present.
2. **Gamified Task Management**: Uses gamification principles to increase employee engagement and productivity by implementing task and achievement tracking systems where employees earn rewards or recognition for completing tasks efficiently.
3. **Integrated Knowledge Base**: Creates a collaborative knowledge base that combines employee expertise with AI, allowing employees to contribute and retrieve information seamlessly.

## Features
### AR Collaboration
- Uses AR.js, a lightweight library for augmented reality on the web.
- Provides a virtual environment for interactive meetings and collaboration.

### Gamified Task Management
- Tracks tasks and achievements using a simple Python script.
- Calculates total points and achievements for employees based on task completion.

### Integrated Knowledge Base
- Developed using a Flask application.
- Provides endpoints for retrieving and adding information to the knowledge base.

## Installation
To install and run the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Google Colab account
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `flask`, `flask-ngrok`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sid1018/ar-collaboration-gamified-task-management.git
   cd ar-collaboration-gamified-task-management
   ```

2. Open each notebook in Google Colab:
   - `AR_Collaboration.ipynb`
   - `Gamified_Task_Management.ipynb`
   - `Integrated_Knowledge_Base.ipynb`

3. Install the required libraries within each notebook:
   ```python
   !pip install pandas flask flask-ngrok
   ```

4. Run each cell in the notebooks to execute the code.

## Usage
### AR Collaboration
1. Load the `AR_Collaboration.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells to create and host an AR.js-based web application for AR collaboration.

### Gamified Task Management
1. Load the `Gamified_Task_Management.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells to track tasks and achievements and calculate total points for employees.

### Integrated Knowledge Base
1. Load the `Integrated_Knowledge_Base.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells to start the Flask application and interact with the knowledge base API.
